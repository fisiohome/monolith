# Background Data Sync

## Overview

Background Data Sync allows administrators to synchronize data from external sources (like Google Sheets) without blocking the user interface. Users can continue working while data updates happen in the background, with real-time notifications keeping them informed of progress.

## Benefits for Users

### 🚀 **Non-Blocking Experience**
- Continue working while data syncs
- No more waiting screens or frozen interfaces
- Immediate feedback that sync has started

### 📊 **Real-Time Updates**
- Live progress notifications
- Automatic page refresh when sync completes
- Clear success or error messages with detailed counts

### 🔄 **Smart Recovery**
- If you refresh the page during sync, progress continues
- Status persists across browser sessions
- Automatically detects and resumes interrupted syncs

### 💡 **User-Friendly Notifications**
- Clear, contextual messages at every step
- Shows exactly how many records were created, updated, unchanged, skipped, or failed
- Color-coded alerts (blue for progress, green for success, red for errors)
- Notifications stay visible until you dismiss them or refresh the page

## How It Works

1. **Click Sync** - Initiates background sync process
2. **Continue Working** - UI remains responsive
3. **Get Notified** - Real-time updates on sync progress
4. **Auto-Refresh** - Data updates automatically when complete

## Where It's Available

Background sync is available on these admin pages:
- **Therapist Management** - Sync therapist data and schedules
- **Location Management** - Sync location information
- **Admin Management** - Sync administrator accounts
- **Brand & Package Management** - Sync service brands and packages

## Using Background Sync

### Starting a Sync

1. Navigate to any management page listed above
2. Click the "Sync Data" button (only visible to administrators)
3. You'll see an immediate confirmation: "Sync started..."

### During Sync

- The sync button shows a loading state with "Syncing..."
- A blue notification appears: "Sync in progress..."
- You can navigate away or refresh the page - sync continues
- A close button (X) is available if you want to dismiss the notification

### After Sync

- **Success**: Green notification appears with detailed results
  - Example: "Processed 151 Karyawan therapists: 2 created, 5 updated, 140 unchanged, 2 skipped, 2 failed."
  - Example: "Processed 10 brands: 0 created, 0 updated, 10 unchanged, 0 skipped, 0 failed. Processed 50 packages: 2 created, 3 updated, 45 unchanged, 0 skipped, 0 failed."
- **Failed**: Red notification explains what went wrong
- Data automatically refreshes to show latest information
- You can dismiss notifications anytime with the X button

## Understanding Sync Results

### Success Messages
Sync results show you exactly what happened:
- **Created** - New records added to the system
- **Updated** - Existing records that were modified
- **Unchanged** - Existing records that had no changes needed
- **Skipped** - Records that were ignored (e.g., missing required fields, invalid data, wrong employment type)
- **Failed** - Records that couldn't be processed (see logs for details)

### Example Results
- **Therapists & Schedules**: "Processed 151 Karyawan therapists: 2 created, 5 updated, 140 unchanged, 2 skipped, 2 failed. Processed 153 schedules: 0 created, 0 updated, 89 unchanged, 64 skipped, 0 failed."
- **Locations**: "Processed 50 locations: 2 created, 3 updated, 40 unchanged, 3 skipped, 2 failed."
- **Admins**: "Processed 20 admins: 1 created, 2 updated, 15 unchanged, 1 skipped, 1 failed."
- **Brands & Packages**: "Processed 10 brands: 0 created, 0 updated, 10 unchanged, 0 skipped, 0 failed. Processed 50 packages: 2 created, 3 updated, 45 unchanged, 0 skipped, 0 failed."
- **Therapist Leaves**: "Processed 30 therapist leaves: 5 created, 2 updated, 10 unchanged, 10 skipped, 3 failed."

## Status Indicators

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 🔄 Running | Blue | Sync is in progress |
| ✅ Success | Green | Data synced successfully |
| ❌ Failed | Red | Sync encountered an error |

## Best Practices

### For Administrators

- **Sync during off-peak hours** for large datasets
- **Wait for completion** before making related changes
- **Check error messages** if sync fails - they often contain actionable information
- **Review the results** to understand what was changed

### For All Users

- **Don't double-click** the sync button
- **Refresh is safe** - sync progress is preserved
- **Close notifications** when you're done reading them
- **Contact support** if sync repeatedly fails

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Sync seems stuck
- **Solution**: Wait a few minutes, then refresh the page. The sync status will reappear if still running.

### Error message appears
- **Solution**: Note the error message and try again. If it persists, contact IT support with the error details.

### Data doesn't update after sync
- **Solution**: Refresh the page manually. If data still doesn't update, the sync may have failed - check for error notifications.

### Notification disappeared too quickly
- **Solution**: Notifications now stay visible until you close them or refresh the page. Click the X button to dismiss when ready.

## Security & Permissions

- Only users with administrator privileges can initiate syncs
- All sync activities are logged for audit purposes
- External data sources are validated before import

## 📋 Sync Log: Complete Audit Trail

Every sync operation is automatically recorded in our comprehensive audit system, giving you complete visibility and control over your data management.

### What Gets Logged?

For each sync operation, we capture:
- **Who performed it**: User name and email
- **When it happened**: Exact start and end timestamps
- **What was synced**: Data type (therapists, brands, packages, etc.)
- **How it went**: Success, failure, or partial completion
- **Detailed results**: Created, updated, failed, and skipped counts
- **Error details**: Specific reasons when things go wrong

### Real-World Benefits

**Quick Problem Resolution**
When issues occur, you'll know exactly:
```
"Processed 151 Karyawan therapists: 2 created, 5 updated, 140 unchanged, 2 skipped, 2 failed.
Created: John Doe (john@example.com), Jane Smith (jane@example.com).
Updated: Mike Johnson (phone_number: +628123456789 → +628123456780).
Skipped: 2 Missing required fields.
Failed: Bob Wilson (Validation failed: Specializations can't be blank)."
```

**Team Accountability**

## Performance Considerations

- **Small datasets** (under 1000 records): Typically completes in under 30 seconds
- **Large datasets** (over 10,000 records): May take several minutes
- **Network speed** affects sync duration
- **Server load** may impact processing time

## Getting Help
